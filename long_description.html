        This application enables the creation of 3D 'solid of revolution' models from archaeological line drawings of vessel profiles. Such an approach is not new, but our attempt via the help of the crowd to allow it to be used to collect large numbers of such models definitely is. 
       This application creates 2D outlines of Roman period amphoras (two-handled clay jars for maritime transport) in a sufficiently structured way that they can be automatically converted into 3D models. The results can be used to build better typologies of how 
       amphoras change over the course eof the Roman Republic and Empire, as well as for calculating useful data such as vessel capacity, centre of mass and behaviour when loaded into the hold of a ship.
        </p>

        <p>
        This particular application takes advantage of the excellent typological resource first created by the University of Southampton and archived with the UK Archaeology Data Service. This archive has an emphasis on amphoras ciculating in the western Mediterranean during the Roman imperial period.
        </p>    
        
        <p>
        For each scanned drawing of an amphora, we would like people to measure a fixed length on drawing to establosh its correct dimensions, and then draw lines marking the outline of the amphora, as well as its interior cavity, handles, etc. 
        This allows the profile to b swept into a 3D shape.
        </p>
