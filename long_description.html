        This application enables the creation of 3D 'solid of revolution' models from archaeological line drawings of vessel profiles.
       In particular, it creates 2D outlines of amphoras (two-handled clay jars for maritime transport) in a step-by-step way that allows them to be automatically converted into 3D models. The results can be used for various kinds of typological modelling, 
       as well as for calculating useful data about an amphora's capacity (how much it could hold), its centre of gravity (when empty or full), points at which it was more likely to break given its shape, and likely behaviour when loaded into the hold of a ship.
        </p>

        <p>
        This particular application considers Roman amphoras (especially those circulating in the wstern Mediterranean during the Roman imperial period) and takes advantage of an excellent typological resource first created by the University of Southampton and archived with the UK Archaeology Data Service.
        </p>    
        
        <p>
        For each scanned drawing of an amphora, we would like people to calibrate the drawing to establish its correct dimensions, and then draw a series of polygons delineating its external shape, internal profile, handles etc. 
        </p>

        If you are interested in what a completed 3D model of this kind looks like, please have a look at the example
