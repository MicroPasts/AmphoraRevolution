				<h3>Profile drawing tutorial for 3D modelling </h3>

					This application is very simple (but it does not yet work on mobile devices). When you participate, the platform will load a scanned drawing of a Roman amphora, an example of of one of the many kinds of specialised clay jar that were used to transport goods around the Mediterranean Sea from as early as the Bronze Age, but with a particular popularity in the Roman Republic (c.509-27 BC) and Empire (ca.27 BC- AD 476, but enduring still longer as the Byzantine empire in the eastern Mediterranean). 
					These drawings are typical of how archaeologists traditionally record the shape and style of containers and other vessel shapes, with the outside of the vessel shown on one side of the drawing and the interior profile shown on the other side (sometimes also with a 'section' shown through other features such as the handles).
					We are asking for help in digitising these drawings as 2-dimensional lines that can then be automatically revolved into a 3D object. Once the scanned drawing has been loaded, you will be asked to click or tap around the edge of the artefact in order to define each of a series of lines representing the exterior and interior profiles, as well as several other features if they are present. 
					Click once every time you wish to add a point along the edge of a line and your final point will snap back onto the one you started with. You must draw one line only for each of these features. In general, we would like you to draw your lines roughly in the middle of pixellated lines you see the and as carefully as you can.

					How to use the applilcation's photo-masking toolbar:
				</p>
				<img src="http://micropasts.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Photomasking_Toolbar.png" width="100%" alt="Photo-masking Toolbar" />
				<p>
				<p>
					<strong>Outside</strong>: This button is selected and enabled by default, indicating that your following actions, i.e. drawing and editing, will relate to the outline of the object.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Inside</strong>: This button is usually not available, but will be a part of the photo-masking toolbar whenever you are presented with an object that has 'holes', such as bracelets. In these cases, the background should be masked out and excluded from the object's final mask. Click on 'Holes' before starting to draw or edit a hole in the object.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Draw</strong>: This option is selected by default, at the beginning of a task. Click on 'Draw' whenever you want to start drawing an outline of the object. Once you complete an outline polygon, the delineating line will turn from blue to yellow.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Edit</strong>: This option is enabled once there is at least one complete line drawn. After clicking on 'Edit', choose the line you wish to edit by clicking once anywhere on it. It will turn blue, and become available for editing such that you will be able to re-position the blue nodes that give the line its shape.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Remove all lines</strong>: Use this option if you wish to start over. Clicking this button will remove all drawn lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Save the drawings</strong>: Click on this button when you are done digitising the object - it will save and submit your work.

					During the task, you can always return to this tutorial via the "Tutorial" button.

					An example of a finished <a href="http://micropasts.org/3D">3D model</a> has now been completed.
