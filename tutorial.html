				<h3>Profile drawing tutorial for 3D modelling </h3>
			</div>
			<div id="0" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					This application is very simple (but it does not yet work on mobile devices). When you participate, the platform will load a scanned drawing of an amphora such as the one below.
					These drawings are typical of how archaeologists traditionally record vessel shapes, with the outside of the vessel shown on one side of the drawing and the interior profile shown on the other side (sometimes also with a 'section' shown through other features such as the handles).
				</p>
				<p>	
					We are asking for help in digitising these drawings as 2-dimensional polygons that can then be used for futher analysis themselves, but have the advantage of also being ready for conversion into a 3D object.
				</p>
				<p>
				Once the scanned drawing has been loaded, you will proceed in a series of steps as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Calibrate the drawing by drawing a line across its scale-bar and entering in the measured distance in metres.</li>
					<li>Draw the external shape of the amphora as polygons.</li>
					<li>Draw the interior of the amphora as two distinct polygons, one for the main cavity and another for neck portion.</li>
					<li>Draw a box around one half of the amphora where there is not profile information (useful for later processing)</li>
					<li>Draw the handles and handle section (if shown).</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					For most of the steps in each task, you will be asked to digitise a line or polygon by clicking along its outline. 
					When you are finished a line or polygon, double click to complete it. 
					If you are doing a polygon it will atomatically join it back up to the first point you created. 
					You use the digitsing toolbar to eithr draw, edit or delete the features you create in each step of the task. 
					You can then click 'Next' to proceed to the next step of the task, and will be allowed to 'Submit all' once you complete all steps.

					How to use the application's digitising toolbar:

				<p>
				<p>
					<strong>Photo loaded</strong>: This label simply indicates whether you are waiting for the scan to be loaded into the application.
					If it says 'Photo loaded', then you can begin digitising.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Scalebar</strong>: This label indicates what part of the amphora you are currently digitising.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Draw</strong>: This option is selected by default, at the beginning of a task. Click on 'Draw' whenever you want to start drawing a line or polygon. Once you complete your drawing of a feature, the delineating line will turn from blue to a different colour.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Edit</strong>: This option is enabled once there is at least one complete feature drawn. After clicking on 'Edit', choose the line or polygon you wish to edit by clicking once anywhere on it. It will turn blue, and become available for editing such that you will be able to re-position the blue nodes that give the line its shape.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Delete</strong>: Use this option if you wish to delete your existing drawing (for the current step only).

					During the task, you can always return to this tutorial via the "Tutorial" button.
