				<h3>Profile drawing tutorial for 3D modelling </h3>
			</div>
			<div id="0" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					This application is very simple (but unfortunately does not yet work on mobile devices). When you participate, the platform will load a scanned drawing of an amphora such as the one below.
					These drawings are typical of how archaeologists traditionally record vessel shapes, with the outside of the vessel shown on one side of the drawing and the interior profile shown on the other side 
					(sometimes also with a further section showing the handle shape).
				</p>
				<p>	
					We are asking for help in digitising these drawings as 2D polygons that can then be used for futher analysis. These polygons also have the advantage of being ready for conversion into a 3D object.
				</p>

			</div>
			<div id="1" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
				Once the scanned drawing has been loaded, you will proceed in a series of steps as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Calibrate the image's dimensions by drawing a line across the scale-bar shown in the drawing and entering its stated width in metres.</li>
					<li>Draw the external shape of the amphora as a polygon.</li>
					<li>Draw the interior of the amphora as two distinct polygons, one for the main cavity and another for neck portion.</li>
					<li>Draw a box around one half of the amphora where there is no profile information (which is useful for later processing)</li>
					<li>Draw the handles and handle section (if shown).</li>
				</ul>
				</p>
				<p>
					For most of the steps in each task, you will be asked to digitise a line or polygon by clicking along its outline. 
					To finish a line or polygon, double click on the last point you wish to enter. 
					If you are drawing a polygon, the last point your enter by double-clicking will automatically be joined  back up to the first point you created. 
					In each step of the task, a digitising toolbar provides options to draw, edit or delete features. 
					Once you have completed a stpe, you can  click 'Next' to proceed to the next part of the task.
					On the last step, you will no longer have a 'Next' button, but will notw see 'Submit all' that you can click to finsh your task.

				<p>
					How to use the application's digitising toolbar:
				</p>
				<img src="http://micropasts-other.s3.amazonaws.com/other/amphs1tut/toolbar.png" width="50%" alt="Digitising Toolbar" />
				<p>
				<p>
					<strong>Photo loaded</strong>: This label simply indicates whether or not you are waiting for the scan to be loaded into the application.
					If it says 'Photo loaded', then you can begin digitising.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Scalebar</strong>: This label indicates what part of the amphora you are currently digitising.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Draw</strong>: This option is selected by default, at the beginning of a task. Click on 'Draw' whenever you want to start drawing a line or polygon. Once you complete your drawing of a feature, the delineating line will turn from blue to a different colour.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Edit</strong>: This option is enabled once there is at least one complete feature drawn. After clicking on 'Edit', choose the line or polygon you wish to edit by clicking once anywhere on it. It will turn blue, and become available for editing such that you will be able to re-position the blue nodes that give the line its shape.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Delete</strong>: Use this option if you wish to delete your existing drawing (for the current step only).
				</p>
				</p>

			<div id="3" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					In step 1, you will be asked to draw a line from on end of the scale-bar shown in the drawing to the other.
				</p>
				<ul> 
				<li>
					Please only enter two points to create the line, not more!
				</li>
				<li>
					Once you have drawn the line, it will appear in green. Then please enter the stated width of the line in the box provided above the drawing.
				</li>
				<li>
					Please make sure you input this width in metres (so if the scalebar says 50cm, enter 0.5).
				</li>
				</ul>

				<p>
					In step 2, you will be asked to draw a polygon outlining the external shape of the amphora.
					You line will be shown in yellow once you complete the sketch. 
					Around handle joins, you may need to guess how the oultine continues, 
					but your end result should look something like the one below.

			<div id="5" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					In step 3, you will be asked to draw a polygon outlining the internal cavity of the amphora.
				</p>
				<p> 
					You line will be shown in pink once you complete the sketch. You focus will be on drawing the intrnal shape of the vessel as 
					shown on the left-hand side of the drawing, and you polygon should then be made to extend an arbitrary amount over the vessel mid-line 
					(it will be clipped accurately in post-processing). You finished polygon (overlayed on the results from the preivous steps) 
					should look something like the one below.
