				<h3>Profile drawing tutorial for 3D modelling </h3>
			</div>
			<div id="0" class="modal-body" style="display:none">
				<p>
					This application is very simple (but it does not yet work on mobile devices). When you participate, the platform will load a scanned drawing of an amphora such as the one below.
					These drawings are typical of how archaeologists traditionally record vessel shapes, with the outside of the vessel shown on one side of the drawing and the interior profile shown on the other side (sometimes also with a 'section' shown through other features such as the handles).
				</p>
				<p>	
					We are asking for help in digitising these drawings as 2-dimensional polygons that can then be used for futher analysis themselves, but have the advantage of also being ready for conversion into a 3D object.
				</p>
				<p>
				Once the scanned drawing has been loaded, you will proceed in a series of steps as follows:
				<ul>
					<li>Calibrate the drawing by drawing a line across its scale-bar and entering in the measured distance in metres.</li>
					<li>Draw the external shape of the amphora as polygons.</li>
					<li>Draw the interior of the amphora as two distinct polygons, one for the main cavity and another for neck portion.</li>
					<li>Draw a box around one half of the amphora where there is not profile information (useful for later processing)</li>
					<li>Draw the handles and handle section (if shown).</li>
				</ul>

					How to use the application's photo-masking toolbar:

				<p>
				<p>
					<strong>Outside</strong>: This button is selected and enabled by default, indicating that your following actions, i.e. drawing and editing, will relate to the outline of the object.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Inside</strong>: This button is usually not available, but will be a part of the photo-masking toolbar whenever you are presented with an object that has 'holes', such as bracelets. In these cases, the background should be masked out and excluded from the object's final mask. Click on 'Holes' before starting to draw or edit a hole in the object.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Draw</strong>: This option is selected by default, at the beginning of a task. Click on 'Draw' whenever you want to start drawing an outline of the object. Once you complete an outline polygon, the delineating line will turn from blue to yellow.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Edit</strong>: This option is enabled once there is at least one complete line drawn. After clicking on 'Edit', choose the line you wish to edit by clicking once anywhere on it. It will turn blue, and become available for editing such that you will be able to re-position the blue nodes that give the line its shape.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Remove all lines</strong>: Use this option if you wish to start over. Clicking this button will remove all drawn lines.
				</p>
				<p>
					<strong>Save the drawings</strong>: Click on this button when you are done digitising the object - it will save and submit your work.

					During the task, you can always return to this tutorial via the "Tutorial" button.
				</p>
				<p>
					An example of a finished <a href="http://micropasts.org/3D">3D model</a> has now been completed.
				</p>
